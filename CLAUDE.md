# RLM Project Instructions

## Memory System

This project uses **WORLD.md** for shared memory (same pattern as `between`).

- Read WORLD.md on session start
- Update when significant decisions/progress occur
- Use `.claude/scratch/` for working documents

## Project Context

Building an MCP server that implements Recursive Language Model patterns for Claude Code — enabling autonomous handling of massive contexts (10M+ tokens).
